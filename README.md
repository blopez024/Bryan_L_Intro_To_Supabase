# Intro to Supabase – Full Stack App

Welcome! This project is a beginner-friendly walkthrough to build a full stack application using Supabase, Express.js, and Vite (vanilla JS). You'll learn how to work with databases, authentication, API routes, and a modern frontend.

## Topics Covered

### ✅ Supabase Fundamentals

You’ll start by creating a new Supabase project and learning how to securely access and store secrets like your database URL and API keys. You’ll explore different tools within the Supabase dashboard, including the Table Editor, SQL Editor, and Authentication module.

### ✅ Working with Databases

You’ll create a persons table using both the graphical Table Editor and raw SQL. You’ll practice inserting, selecting, and deleting data while learning how to safely manage tables and columns.

### ✅ Row-Level Security (RLS)

You’ll learn about RLS, a feature that controls access to table data at the row level. You'll enable security policies that restrict read/write access to authenticated users only—and see what happens when unauthenticated users try to access protected data.

### ✅ Authentication

You’ll configure Supabase Authentication to allow users to sign in using email and password, and connect this logic into your backend to ensure only authorized access to protected data.

### ✅ Backend Development with Node.js

You’ll use Express.js to build a RESTful API that connects your frontend to your Supabase database. You'll also use Faker.js to generate realistic fake user data to seed the database, gaining insight into mocking data for development and testing.

### ✅ Frontend Integration

On the frontend, you’ll build a simple UI that displays users in a styled grid. You’ll also build a form that allows new users to be added. You’ll learn how to fetch data from the backend and dynamically render it using JavaScript.

### ✅ Full Stack Connectivity

The project ties together client-side form submissions, server-side API handling, and database operations. By the end, you’ll have a working full-stack application that demonstrates core concepts in modern web development.

## Summary

By the end of this exercise, you will:

- Understand how to structure and secure a Supabase database.
- Use Node.js and Express to handle backend logic and API routing.
- Use vanilla JavaScript with Vite to build an interactive frontend.
- Connect all parts of the stack for a fully functional, real-world-style application.
